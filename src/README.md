## Add the data source

To configure Azure authentication see [Configure Azure Active Directory (AD) authentication](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/azure-monitor/#configure-azure-active-directory-ad-authentication).

In Grafana Enterprise, update the .ini configuration file: [Configure Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/). Depending on your setup, the .ini file is located [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#configuration-file-location).
Add the following setting in the **[auth]** section :

```bash
[auth]
azure_auth_enabled = true
```

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If you are using Azure authentication settings do not enable `Forward OAuth identity`. Both use the same HTTP authorization headers. Azure settings will get overwritten by the OAuth token.
